# Build Client UI

### Prerequisites
This assumes you have the following installed on your computer and made available to your console/command-line:
- git (see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) or git bash on Windows (see https://gitforwindows.org/)
- node and npm (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- yarn (see https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Build UI

0. Fork client source code repository if you haven't already done so (see [Fork client source code](/client-config/source-code.md))
1. Clone your client repository fork: `$ git clone https://github.com/[your-fork]/impactoss-client.git`
2. Inside your local repository install dependencies: `$ yarn` (this can take a while...)
3. Build: `$ npm run build` (again this can take a while...)
