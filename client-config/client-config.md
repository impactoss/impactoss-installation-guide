# Overview: Client configuration

The IMPACT OSS server is a React Javascript application.

IMPACT OSS can be configured in many different ways to suit each State's individual set up and requirements, some of which are required and some that are optional.

Before you start we recommend to to fork the source code repository from https://github.com/impactoss/impactoss-client to existing GitHub user or organisation, then

1. [Configure application settings](/client-config/application.md)
2. [Edit labels, text & translations](/client-config/locales.md)
3. Optional (required if changed on server): [Configure taxonomies](/client-config/categories.md)
4. Optional: [Configure theme & branding](/client-config/theme.md)

> Note: while the `master` branch are set up with the default configuration, we have also included a basic configuration with limited taxonomies in the `rights-only-configuration` branch which is compatible with the branch of the same name of the server repository (see [Server Configuration](/server-config/server-config.md))
