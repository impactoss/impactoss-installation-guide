#### About IMPACT OSS

IMPACT OSS is an Open Source Software (OSS) for Integrated Management and Planning of Actions (IMPACT), created to assist States with coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

IMPACT OSS is based on [Sadata](https://github.com/nmrf/sadata), the platform initially designed and developed by Ashley Bowe and [Unfold Data](http://unfolddata.com) for Samoa's National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up (NMRF), and was enhanced by Unfold Data for the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission](http://hrc.co.nz/) to replace the first version of its interactive [National Plan of Action](http://npa.hrc.co.nz) (also designed and developed by Unfold Data) that to some extent can be considered a conceptual ancestor of Sadata.
