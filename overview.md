# Installation overview

This installation guide provides detailed instructions on how to configure and install both server and client applications (also see [System components](/components.md)). Accordingly this guide is split into 4 main parts:

1. **[Server configuration](server-config/server-config.md)**
2. **[Server installation](server-installation/server-installation.md)**
3. **[Client configuration](client-config/client-config.md)**
4. **[Client installation](client-installation/client-installation.md)**

> Please note: while the described configuration options are universal, the installation options are for a specific recommended set-up only.
